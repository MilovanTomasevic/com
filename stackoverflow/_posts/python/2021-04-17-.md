How can I color Python logging output?

## [Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/384076/how-can-i-color-python-logging-output) by [airmind](https://stackoverflow.com/users/48087/airmind)

Some time ago, I saw a Mono application with colored output, presumably because of its log system (because all the messages were standardized).

Now, Python has the `logging` module, which lets you specify a lot of options to customize output. So, I'm imagining something similar would be possible with Python, but I can’t find out how to do this anywhere.

Is there any way to make the Python `logging` module output in color?

What I want (for instance) errors in red, debug messages in blue or yellow, and so on.

Of course this would probably require a compatible terminal (most modern terminals are); but I could fallback to the original `logging` output if color isn't supported.

Any ideas how I can get colored output with the logging module?

The syntax for decorators with arguments is a bit different - the decorator with arguments should return a function that will *take a function* and return another function. So it should really return a normal decorator. A bit confusing, right? What I mean is:

```py
def decorator_factory(argument):
    def decorator(function):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            funny_stuff()
            something_with_argument(argument)
            result = function(*args, **kwargs)
            more_funny_stuff()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```
[Here][1] you can read more on the subject - it's also possible to implement this using callable objects and that is also explained there.

Install the colorlog package, you can use colors in your log messages immediately:
- Obtain a `logger` instance, exactly as you would normally do.
- Set the logging level. You can also use the constants like `DEBUG`
and `INFO` from the logging module directly.
- Set the message formatter to be the `ColoredFormatter` provided
by the `colorlog` library.

```py
import colorlog

logger = colorlog.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(colorlog.colorlog.logging.DEBUG)

handler = colorlog.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(colorlog.ColoredFormatter())
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.debug("Debug message")
logger.info("Information message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
logger.error("Error message")
logger.critical("Critical message")
```

output:

***

### UPDATE: extra info
Just update `ColoredFormatter`:
```py
handler.setFormatter(colorlog.ColoredFormatter('%(log_color)s [%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s [%(filename)s.%(funcName)s:%(lineno)d] %(message)s', datefmt='%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S'))
```
output:
